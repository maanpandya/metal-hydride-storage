    "The <b>goals</b> of this notebook are:  \n",
    "1. to reproduce the results by Darzi e.a. in their 2016 paper entitled <i>Absorption and Desorption of Hydrogen in Long Metal Hydride Tank Equipped with Phase Change Material Jacket</i>. This paper discusses the mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of metal-hydride materials for the storage (absorption (intake) and desorption (release)) of hygrogen gas. The [Van 't Hoff plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_'t_Hoff_equation) is used to estimate the enthalpy (heat intake or release) and entropy of the chemical reaction of binding and release of hydrogen gas; \n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>0D transient modeling</b>: to construct a zero-dimensional (perfectly stirred reactor) transient model for the storage (scenario-1) and release (scenario-2) of hydrogen gas from tank with and without MOFs. These models tracks the coupled time-evolution of two species. The first is the density of hydrogen gas density injected into the reactor. The second is the solid density (here intended as the amount of hydrogen gas absorbed by the MOF in the tank). The model is driven by a mass-flow rate. This mass-flow rate is linearly proportional to the solid density. Time stepping methods available in DifferentialEquations.jl will be used to solve these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>1D steady-state modeling</b>: to construct a one-dimensional stationary models for the storage (scenario-1) and release (scenario-2) of hydrogen gas from tank with (and without) MOFs. The model will consists of two submodels. The first submodel is a model for laminar non-isothermal flow of the hydrogen gas through the bed of metal-oxide material bed. This material bed will be modeled as a porous medium. This first submodel will consist of conservation of mass (diffusion equation for the pressure resulting in a pressure gradient over the reactor), conservation of momentum (convection-diffusion equation for the velocity) and conservation of energy. The second submodel is a model for the spatial and temporal variation of the hydrogen gas density and solid density. These models can be solved using shooting method available in DifferentialEquations.jl, finite difference methods implemented in FlemishFish.jl and finite element implemented in Ferrite.jl.\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Assumptions</b>: Model the tranport of heat by diffusion and convection with the previously computed flow field. Neglect effect of heat on the flow field. Solve pressure-velocity first. Solve temperature afterwards (either after the final time step or after each step).   \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Problem Formulation</b>: PDE + IC + BC. More later. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discretization in space</b>: using finite elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discretization in time in case of linear equation for steady state for temperature</b>: assemble and solve linear system for temperature in steady state. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discretization in time in case of transient analysis for temperature</b>: both the explicit and implicit time integration will require the implementation of a right-hand function for the temperature. The implicit time integration will additionally require the assembly and linear system solve with the Jacobian. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Coding</b>: Extend the tutorial [Ferrite Incompressible Navier-Stokes](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/tutorials/ns_vs_diffeq/) with temperature field weakly coupled to pressure-velocity field.  \n",

    " \n",
    "<b>Assumptions</b>: Account for heat effects in the flow field (e.g. temperature dependence of the molecular viscosity of the gas). Solve pressure-velocity-temperature in coupled fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Problem Formulation</b>: identical to above, aside for heat effects in the flow field. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discretization in space</b>: using finite elements. How to define the right-hand function for the non-linear contribution? How to define the Jacobian?  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discretization in time</b>: solve for pressure-velocity-temperature in steady state and in (explicit/implicit) transient manner. The explicit time integration will require the implementation of a right-hand function for the pressure-velocity-temperature. The implicit time integration will additionally require the assembly and linear system solve with the block-coupled Jacobian.\n",
